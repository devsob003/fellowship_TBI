**Project Title:** Fellowship Application Management System

**Project Description:**

The Fellowship Application Management System is a dynamic web application designed to streamline and manage the application process for two fellowship programs: the Masters Fellowship Program and the Doctoral Fellowship Program. The system is divided into two main portals - the Admin Portal and the Student Portal - each serving specific functions and roles.

**Admin Portal:**

*Overview:*
The Admin Portal is primarily responsible for the administration and management of the fellowship application process. It provides the necessary tools and interfaces for administrators to review and process applications efficiently.

*Key Features:*
1. **Application Review:** Administrators can access and review applications submitted by students for both the Masters and Doctoral Fellowship Programs.
   
2. **Eligibility Verification:** The system automatically checks the eligibility criteria, including economic weaker section status, qualifications, and age, ensuring that applicants meet the necessary requirements.

3. **Document Verification:** Administrators can view and verify uploaded documents, such as EWS certificates, PwD certificates (if applicable), bonafide certificates, and Ph.D. registration certificates.

4. **Communication:** The Admin Portal allows administrators to communicate with applicants, request additional information, or provide updates on the application status.

5. **Selection Process:** Admins can manage the selection process, approve or reject applications, and update the application status accordingly.

6. **Data Management:** Admins can access and manage candidate data, including personal details, educational qualifications, and additional information.

7. **Student Progress Monitoring:** The portal provides an overview of all enrolled students, their course, specialization, and current status.

**Student Portal:**

*Overview:*
The Student Portal is designed to facilitate applicants' interaction with the fellowship application system and, once selected, to provide a platform for students to monitor their progress and submit required reports and documents.

*Key Features:*
1. **Application Submission:** Students can fill out and submit applications for either the Masters Fellowship Program or the Doctoral Fellowship Program.

2. **Document Upload:** Applicants can securely upload essential documents, including certificates, photographs, signatures, motivational letters, project summaries, and detailed CVs.

3. **Progress Tracking:** Once enrolled, students can use the portal to monitor the status of their applications, including whether they are submitted, in-process, or approved.

4. **Activity Reporting:** Students can submit various reports, such as 6-month progress reports, marksheets, and information on other achievements (e.g., conference participation, publications, patents).

5. **Communication:** Students can receive updates and communications from administrators regarding their application status.

6. **Personal Information:** Applicants can update their personal information, contact details, and educational qualifications as needed.

7. **Undertaking:** Students are required to acknowledge an undertaking, confirming the accuracy of the information provided and their adherence to program guidelines.

**Program Management and Monitoring System:**

*Overview:*
This section of the system allows both administrators and students to access a dashboard that provides an overview of their program-related activities and status.

*Key Features:*
1. **Dashboard:** A customizable dashboard displays program-related information, including course type (Master or Ph.D.), specialization, university name, candidate name, email, and contact number.

2. **Activity Tracking:** Administrators and students can track various activities, including the submission of 6-month progress reports, marksheets, and other achievements. The system automatically generates summaries of these activities.

3. **Activity Status:** The dashboard displays the status of activities, such as submitted, commented, or approved, for easy reference.

The Fellowship Application Management System enhances efficiency and transparency in the application and selection process, ensuring that eligible candidates are considered for the fellowship programs. It also provides a convenient platform for students to monitor their progress and submit required documents and reports, simplifying administrative tasks for program administrators.
